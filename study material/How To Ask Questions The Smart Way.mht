talking about.=20
Don't ask <SPAN class=3Demphasis><EM>us</EM></SPAN> questions. We'll =
just ignore=20
you. We are here to show you how to get help from people who actually =
know about=20
the software or hardware you're dealing with, but 99.9% of the time that =

<P>In the world of <A class=3Dulink=20
href=3D"http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html" =
target=3D_top>hackers</A>,=20
the kind of answers you get to your technical questions depends as much =
on the=20
way you ask the questions as on the difficulty of developing the answer. =
This=20
guide will teach you how to ask questions in a way more likely to get =
you a=20
satisfactory answer.</P>
<P>Now that use of open source has become widespread, you can often get =
as good=20
answers from other, more experienced users as from hackers. This is a =
Good=20
Thing; users tend to be just a little bit more tolerant of the kind of =
failures=20
newbies often have. Still, treating experienced users like hackers in =
the ways=20
we recommend here will generally be the most effective way to get useful =
answers=20
out of them, too.</P>
<P>The first thing to understand is that hackers actually like hard =
problems and=20
good, thought-provoking questions about them. If we didn't, we wouldn't =
be here.=20
If you give us an interesting question to chew on we'll be grateful to =
you; good=20
questions are a stimulus and a gift. Good questions help us develop our=20
understanding, and often reveal problems we might not have noticed or =
thought=20
about otherwise. Among hackers, =E2=80=9C<SPAN class=3Dquote>Good =
question!</SPAN>=E2=80=9D is a=20
strong and sincere compliment.</P>
<P>Despite this, hackers have a reputation for meeting simple questions =
with=20
what looks like hostility or arrogance. It sometimes looks like we're=20
reflexively rude to newbies and the ignorant. But this isn't really =
true.</P>
<P>What we are, unapologetically, is hostile to people who seem to be =
unwilling=20
to think or to do their own homework before asking questions. People =
like that=20
are time sinks =E2=80=94 they take without giving back, and they waste =
time we could=20
have spent on another question more interesting and another person more =
worthy=20
of an answer. We call people like this =E2=80=9C<SPAN =
class=3Dquote>losers</SPAN>=E2=80=9D (and=20
for historical reasons we sometimes spell it =E2=80=9C<SPAN=20
class=3Dquote>lusers</SPAN>=E2=80=9D).</P>
<P>We realize that there are many people who just want to use the =
software we=20
write, and who have no interest in learning technical details. For most =
people,=20
a computer is merely a tool, a means to an end; they have more important =
things=20
to do and lives to live. We acknowledge that, and don't expect everyone =
to take=20
an interest in the technical matters that fascinate us. Nevertheless, =
our style=20
of answering questions is tuned for people who <SPAN=20
class=3Demphasis><EM>do</EM></SPAN> take such an interest and are =
willing to be=20
active participants in problem-solving. That's not going to change. Nor =
should=20
it; if it did, we would become less effective at the things we do =
best.</P>
<P>We're (largely) volunteers. We take time out of busy lives to answer=20
questions, and at times we're overwhelmed with them. So we filter =
ruthlessly. In=20
particular, we throw away questions from people who appear to be losers =
in order=20
to spend our question-answering time more efficiently, on winners.</P>
<P>If you find this attitude obnoxious, condescending, or arrogant, =
check your=20
assumptions. We're not asking you to genuflect to us =E2=80=94 in fact, =
most of us would=20
love nothing more than to deal with you as an equal and welcome you into =
our=20
culture, if you put in the effort required to make that possible. But =
it's=20
simply not efficient for us to try to help people who are not willing to =

<P>The first step, therefore, is to find the right forum. Again, Google =

other Web-searching methods are your friend. Use them to find the =

<P>Shooting off an e-mail to a person or forum which you are not =

<P>When selecting a Web forum, newsgroup or mailing list, don't trust =

blunder, you'd be best off not asking any questions at all until you get =
it.</P>
<P>In general, questions to a well-selected public forum are more likely =

<P>Much of what looks like rudeness in hacker circles is not intended to =
give=20
offense. Rather, it's the product of the direct, =
cut-through-the-bullshit=20
communications style that is natural to people who are more concerned =
about=20

<P>When you perceive rudeness, try to react calmly. If someone is really =
acting=20
out, it is very likely a senior person on the list or newsgroup or forum =
will=20
call him or her on it. If that <SPAN =
class=3Demphasis><EM>doesn't</EM></SPAN>=20
happen and you lose your temper, it is likely that the person you lose =
it at was=20
behaving within the hacker community's norms and <SPAN=20
class=3Demphasis><EM>you</EM></SPAN> will be considered at fault. This =
will hurt=20
your chances of getting the information or help you want.</P>
<P>On the other hand, you will occasionally run across rudeness and =
posturing=20
that is quite gratuitous. The flip-side of the above is that it is =
acceptable=20
form to slam real offenders quite hard, dissecting their misbehavior =
with a=20
sharp verbal scalpel. Be very, very sure of your ground before you try =
this,=20
however. The line between correcting an incivility and starting a =
pointless=20
flamewar is thin enough that hackers themselves not infrequently blunder =
across=20
it; if you are a newbie or an outsider, your chances of avoiding such a =
blunder=20
are low. If you're after information rather than entertainment, it's =
better to=20
keep your fingers off the keyboard than to risk this.</P>
<P>(Some people assert that many hackers have a mild form of autism or=20

that his=20

<P>There have been hacker forums where, out of some misguided sense of=20
hyper-courtesy, participants are banned from posting any fault-finding =

(in that fashion) or=20
useful: Pick one.</P>
<P>Remember: When that hacker tells you that you've screwed up, and (no =
matter=20
how gruffly) tells you not to do it again, he's acting out of concern =
for (1)=20
you and (2) his community. It would be much easier for him to ignore you =

have a=20
little dignity, don't whine, and don't expect to be treated like a =

just because you're a newcomer with a theatrically hypersensitive soul =

delusions of entitlement.</P>
<P>Sometimes people will attack you personally, flame without an =

<P>In fact, the form of that last question is closely based on a real =
incident=20
that happened in August 2001 on the linux-kernel mailing list (lkml). I =
(Eric)=20
was the one asking the question that time. I was seeing mysterious =
lockups on a=20
Tyan S2462 motherboard. The list members supplied the critical =
information I=20
needed to solve them.</P>
<P>By asking the question in the way I did, I gave people something to =
chew on;=20
I made it easy and attractive for them to get involved. I demonstrated =
respect=20
for my peers' ability and invited them to consult with me as a peer. I =
also=20
demonstrated respect for the value of their time by telling them the =
blind=20
alleys I had already run down.</P>
<P>Afterwards, when I thanked everyone and remarked how well the process =
had=20
worked, an lkml member observed that he thought it had worked not =
because I'm a=20

because I asked the question=20
in the proper form.</P>
<P>Hackers are in some ways a very ruthless meritocracy; I'm certain he =

right, and that if I <SPAN class=3Demphasis><EM>had</EM></SPAN> behaved =

<P>If you can't get an answer, please don't take it personally that we =

it's hard to spot the difference from outside.</P>
<P>In general, simply re-posting your question is a bad idea. This will =

<P>There are other sources of help you can go to, often sources better =

<P>There are many online and local user groups who are enthusiasts about =

<P>There are also plenty of commercial companies you can contract with =

both large and small (Red Hat and SpikeSource are two of the best known; =

help! After all, if your car engine blows a head gasket, chances are you =
would=20

<P>For popular software like Linux, there are at least 10,000 users per=20
developer. It's just not possible for one person to handle the support =

from over 10,000 users. Remember that even if you have to pay for =
support, you=20
are still paying much less than if you had to buy the software as well =
(and=20
support for closed-source software is usually more expensive and less =
