get a mac-address flooding tool. ie. dsniff, macof.. when u flood the cam table of the switch with bogus mac-address, fill the cam table to the brim, then the switch will start acting like a hub.
 
If the switch can't learn anymore mac-address, (since it's filled up with bogus macs) it'll start forwarding incoming packets out all ports. There u go, u hv a hub. ;)
