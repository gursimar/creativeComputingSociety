<H1>Symbian Programming - Bluetooth WAP/Sync/Internet</H1>
<H2>Update!</H2>
<P>More user-friendly instructions and software is now available from <A =

href=3D"http://gnubox.dnsalias.org/gnubox/">http://gnubox.dnsalias.org/gn=
ubox/</A>.=20
They even include support for the 6630 and 6680 via a ppp module copied =
from a=20
6682... Nokia: could you get out of bed with the operators, they'll die =
in a=20
couple of years anyway.</P>
<H2>Note</H2>
<P>This page is intended for people reasonably familiar with TCP/IP =
routing=20
(including concepts like PPP, proxy-arp, NAT, IP addresses, subnets). If =
you=20
don't think that you understand these concepts, please refer to a good =
TCP/IP=20
text first.</P>
<P><B>Update: </B>Angad Singh noticed that if you use Internet Sharing =
on=20
Windows XP instead of NAT you can share a dialup connection with the =
phone.</P>
<P><B>Updated for 6600!</B> These instructions work on my phone with =
software=20
version 3.42.1. Reported working on 4.09.1 as well. </P>
<P>It seems that you'll need a permanent Internet connection (LAN) to =
make this=20
work for the 6600. Windows XP/2000 Pro doesn't allow you to NAT to a =
dialup :-(.=20
Only 'demand-dial' interfaces are available in netsh, not normal =
dialups, and=20
those seem to be only available on Server. If anyone knows how to get =
around=20
this, please contact me. You could probably use a proxy instead of NAT =
if you=20
are satisfied with proxyable protocols (HTTP), like the one from <A=20
href=3D"http://www.analogx.com/contents/download/network/proxy.htm">Analo=
g</A>.</P>
<H2>Intro</H2>
<P>You've probably noticed that although you can use third-party =
software over=20
the <A=20
href=3D"http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1001649.html">MRouter-Blue=
tooth</A>=20
connection, you can't use Nokia's own software like the WAP browser or =
Syncml.=20
These require a functional Access point that is WAP-enabled. Nokia has=20
(purposefully?) made this impossible to set up via the phone UI, but it =
is quite=20
possible to do programmatically.</P>
<P>There is a piece of software called <A=20
href=3D"http://www.symbianos.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/gnubox/">gnubox</A> =
that is=20
supposed to be able to this. It probably is on some software versions, =
but not=20
all. I have modified the software to work on the newer software =
versions. You=20
can download the <A =
href=3D"http://mikie.iki.fi/symbian/gnubox.zip">source</A> or=20
just the <A href=3D"http://mikie.iki.fi/symbian/gnubox.SIS">phone =
installation=20
file (7650)</A>, <A=20
href=3D"http://mikie.iki.fi/symbian/gnubox6600.SIS">6600</A>.</P>
<P><EM>All that the gnubox does is modify the communications database=20
settings.</EM> You need it because the user interface=20
(Settings|Connection|Access points) doesn't allow you to specify the =
right=20
settings. No software is needed to run in the background for this to =
work.</P>
<P>On the 6600 it's been made even harder. The phone still has all the=20
components needed for using the Internet (and WAP) over Bluetooth, but =
it's been=20
purposefully made so that it won't use the mRouter connection for this. =
It all=20
hangs on the IP it gets: if it's from the range mRouter hands out =
(169.254.x.x)=20
it won't route any traffic through the interface; if it's something else =

everything works.</P>
<H2>Instructions</H2>
<H3>7650: On your PC (Windows)</H3>
<P>First make sure that your PC Suite works with Bluetooth. TDK has <A=20
href=3D"http://www.communica.se/tdk/support/How%20to%20Configure%20the%20=
Nokia%20PC%20Suite.pdf">a=20
nice set of instructions for this</A>.</P>
<P>Install <A =
href=3D"http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/1,6566,1_1_30,00.html">Nokia=20
Gateway Simulator (part of the Nokia Mobile Internet Toolkit)</A>. When =
you are=20
ready to test WAP, run the WAP gateway console =
(Start|Programs|Nokia|Nokia WAP=20
Gateway Simulator|WAP Gateway Simulator 4.0 - Console). You can use some =
other=20
WAP gateway as well, e.g. Kannel.</P>
<H3>6600: On your PC (Windows XP)</H3>
<P>Check that your firewall isn't blocking the connection we want to =
use.=20
Probably best to disable it first, get these things running and then =
enable it=20
again, possibly changing some settings for it.</P>
<P>Set up an Incoming Connection for Bluetooth as described by <A=20
href=3D"http://members.chello.se/micce/Bluetooth-Setup.pdf">Troy =
Fontaine</A>.=20
Make sure PC-Suite/mRouter isn't enabled for the Bluetooth serial =
port.</P>
<P>If you are able to hand out real addresses on your local area =
network, this=20
is enough. If not, read further.</P>
<P>Set the Incoming Connection to hand out addresses from a private =
range, e.g.=20
10.0.0.1-10.0.0.254. Remove Internet Connection Sharing from all =
interfaces.=20
Enable NAT on your Windows XP box by typing in a CMD window: <PRE>netsh =
routing ip nat install
netsh routing ip nat add interface "YOUR LAN INTERFACE NAME" full
netsh routing ip nat add interface Internal private
</PRE>Look up the interface name in the control panel network =
connections. <B>A=20
dialup connection won't work, use a proxy instead.</B> Note that the =
'Internal'=20
name will depend on the language of your Windows XP (e.g. in Finnish =
it's=20
'Sis=E4inen' instead). The first line enables network address =
translation (NAT),=20
the second adds your LAN connection as something to send NATted traffic=20
<I>to</I> and the third your incoming connections (they all get attached =
to the=20
'Internal' interface) as sources for NATted traffic.
<P></P>
<P>I don't know about WAP on the 6600, since it's WAP 2.0 now. The Nokia =
gateway=20
might support it, or might not. I don't know how to tell the phone who =
to=20
connect.</P>
<H3>On the phone</H3>
<P><B>This will modify your communications settings. Back up your phone=20

<P>I have zero experience of Max OS X, but from what I understand from =
