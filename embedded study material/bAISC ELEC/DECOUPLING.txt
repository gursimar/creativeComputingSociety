CONCLUSION

As a conclusion to this post,we see that the circuit the user a inductor and capacitor is more accurate as it forms a RLC circuit. This RLC circuit stablises the voltage source against the high switching noise that is produced by the random ON OFF circuits in the IC...
This switching noise can also be reduced if a single capacitor is used as it has parastic resistance as well as paristic inductance so even without a L and (its R , inductor has a resistance also so a LC circuit is never possible so never analysed ) the circuit is LCR but using a small inductor as shown in the circuit is a move towards accuracy and reliability of the ADC ...




But one point is still not clear > is the capacitor in series with RESET and VCC is an error or some improvment to the circuit .. that I posted earlier

sorry for tha late post :((


noise caused by the other elements of the PCB is shunted through the capacitor ( as capacitor shunts ac components( noise)) ..
This noise is in the form of a AC signal superimposed on a DC signal..So we need a docoupling capacitor
Another kind of decoupling is stopping a portion of a circuit from being affected by switching that happens in another portion
