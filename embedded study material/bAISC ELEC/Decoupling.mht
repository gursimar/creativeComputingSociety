it is the process of placing an L-C network adjacent to the IC to supply =

decoupling capacitors become very inefficient in providing effective=20

The key to using multiple capacitors for high frequency decoupling is =
to, (1)=20
make them all the same value, and (2) spread them out around the IC -- =
do not=20
place them together.=20
<P>The reason that this works is that when equal value L-C networks are =
placed=20
in parallel, the total capacitance is equal to NxC and the total =
inductance is=20
L/N where N is the number of capacitors used.&nbsp; In other words, for =
parallel=20
L-C networks the capacitance value multiples up by the number of =
networks used=20
and the inductance value divides down by the number of networks =
used.&nbsp; Both=20
of these effects are working in our favor.&nbsp; For a fixed value of=20
inductance, the effectiveness of the high frequency decoupling network =
is,=20
therefore, solely dependent on the number of capacitors that you =
use.&nbsp; The=20
more capacitors the lower the total inductance, and the better the high=20
frequency decoupling.&nbsp; I often recommend from 4 to 20 decoupling =
capacitors=20
according to the application.&nbsp; Intel, as an example,&nbsp; =
recommends 41=20
decoupling capacitors in order effectively decouple a Pentium=AE-2 =
microprocessor=20
(Intel Application Note AP-579).&nbsp; When a large number of capacitors =
are=20
use, there exact placement becomes less important than when only one or =
two=20
capacitors are used.&nbsp; Just spread them out around the IC, and try =
to place=20
them symmetrically (or evenly) with respect to the IC. </P>
<P>There are a large number of people that use and/or recommend the use =
of=20
multiple capacitors of different values.&nbsp; My recommendation is =
don't!&nbsp;=20
The problem with this approach is that the different value capacitors =
produce an=20
anti-resonance, or cross-resonance (which produces an impedance =
peak).&nbsp; Not=20
a desirable result!&nbsp; For those still considering the use of =
different value=20
capacitors I would suggest that you look at the Bruce Archambeault and =
Clayton=20
Paul papers referenced below.&nbsp; The <A=20

rd%20power--ground%20plane%20decoupling.pdf?regid=3D">Bruce=20
Archambeault paper</A> in particular gives measured values of decoupling =

effectiveness, using a network analyzer.&nbsp; For the case of multiple =
value=20
capacitors it concludes, "There is no noticeable improvement in the high =

frequency decoupling performance when a second capacitor value is =
added.&nbsp;=20
In fact the decoupling performance is worse in a frequency range where =
much of=20
the typical noise energy exists (50-200 MHz)."&nbsp; Archambeault's data =
shows=20
that the noise increased by 25 dB (as a result&nbsp; of the =
cross-resonance=20
between the different value capacitors) between 50 and 200 MHz when two=20
different capacitor values were used, as compared to the results when =
all the=20
capacitors were of the same value. </P>
<P>Although the effectiveness of the decoupling at high frequency is =
dependent=20
on the number of capacitors used (since the inductance is reduced to =
L/N), the=20
effectiveness of the decoupling at low frequency has nothing to do with =
the=20
number of capacitors used.&nbsp; The low frequency decoupling =
effectiveness is=20
solely dependent upon the value of capacitance (CxN) that all the =
capacitors add=20
up to.&nbsp; The larger the value of CxN the lower the&nbsp; frequency =
that the=20
decoupling will still be&nbsp; effective. </P>
